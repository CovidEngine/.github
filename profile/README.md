# We build things for fun.

Haxx.nz are a collective of software developers, designers and makers of all kinds who build things for fun. The projects we work on range from silly proof of concept ideas, to free open source tools that do social good.

If youâ€™ve got skills, or want to learn how to collaboratively build something, join the crew on Discord. it's a great way to meet like minded people to work on stuff with. We also accept requests to maintain projects that you no longer want to support, but might still have real users.
